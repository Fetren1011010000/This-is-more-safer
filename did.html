        <h2> <b><i>WHO ASKED?</i></b> </h2>
        <p>
        In this paragraph I'm gonna talk about the topic "Who asked?" with mathmatics (with the help of the youtuber "Dapz").
        <br>
        Now the expression for "Who asked" is simply who asked. But since nobody asked, the person who asked is imaginary.
        <br>
        Since the square root of -1 is also imaginary we can reasonably conclude that who asked = sqrt(-1) which is i.
        <br>
        So the answer for the question who asked, is that i asked. So if a person says who asked, you can simply say i asked.

        <h2>When is your <b><i>dad</i></b> coming back with the milk?</h2>
        <p>
        In this paragraph I'm gonna talk about the topic "When is your dad coming back with the milk?" (with the help of the youtuber "Dapz").
        <br>
        I will make an example of a person "Kashif". His dad when to the grocery store with his whole company and with his $3 to buy some milk.
        <br>
        But he didn't come home for 12 years. Now get a sheet of paper and draw a y axis and the x axis. 
        <br>
        The y axis represents the time until your dad gets home, and the x axis is your dad's distance from home. I decide the y and the x axis because I'm an asian.
        <br>
        Let's now set up an equation. f(x)=|3/-x | .
        <br>
        3 is the amount of money that your dad took to buy milk and in order to buy one milk he needs to go one trip to the grocery store.
        <br>
        But realize if x is negative. If x is negative that means the y is also negative, and time can't be negative so the equation is actually 
        <br> 
        the absolute value of 3/-x. Now graph that on desmos. 
        <br>
        In order to find out when your kashif's dad is coming back we have to find the limit as x goes to 0 of the function f(x).
        <br>
        So basically we have to find what value does the y value approach as the x value approaches 0.
        <br>
        If you look on desmos, the y value or the time it takes until kashif's dad gets home approaches infinity.
        <br>
        If you write this as an equation, the limit as x approaches 0 in respect to the equation of the absolute value of 
        <br>
        3/-x is infinity. So BASICALLY kashif's "DAD" is NEVER coming back home, and there's your final solution.

        <h2>Mathematical proof that Women are problems</h2>
        <p>
        w(women) = t * m 
        <br>
        but time equals money, so w = m * m .
        <br>
        We can rewrite that as w=m^2. But what is the root of all your problems? MONEY!
        <br>
        So m = sqrt(p). The way to get rid of that square root is putting m to the power of 2 and putting sqrt(p) to the power of 2.
        <br>
        Since m^2 is also equal to women, you can get the equation w = p. There we go! We have a mathematical proof that women are problems.
